Author Guidelines


Manuscripts submitted to Papers in Physics must contain substantial new results
and ideas that advance in a non-trivial way our knowledge of physics.

Authors must decide at submission time the editorial treatment that 
Papers in Physics should give to the manuscript: traditional review or open 
review. Authors must ensure that any submission has not been previously 
published, nor is it before another journal for consideration.

Papers in Physics has no page limits. However, very long manuscripts are 
susceptible of higher publishing costs (see APC).  Authors are encouraged to 
publish supplementary material at no extra cost.

Papers in Physics has a copyleft policy. Authors must agree to let the article

EDITORIAL TREATMENTS


Traditional review

In traditional review, manuscripts are submitted to anonymous reviewers seeking 
constructive criticism and editors make a decision as to whether publication 
is appropriate.

Open review

In open review, manuscripts are sent to reviewers who agree to unveil their 
identity. If the paper is considered suitable for publication, the names of all
involved will be published in the article information.  The the reviewer's 
comments and the author's replies may be also published together with the main 
article when considered valuable for the readers according to the editor in 
charge of the manuscript. In this way, Papers in Physics promotes open 
discussions of controversies among specialists that are of help to the reader 
and to the transparency of the editorial process. Moreover, reviewers receive 
their due recognition by publishing a recorded citable report.



MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION

	name must be written in full. Separate authors' names by commas only.

Address: Provide postal address for each author. Use Arabic superscripts to 
	link authors to addresses.

Abstract: Aim at less than 500 words. Clearly indicate the system under 
	consideration, the properties studied, the methods used and the main 
	conclusions drawn in the paper.

Text: Separate the text in sections beginning by "Introduction" and ending 
	with "Conclusions".

Figures: Use PostScript, PDF or EPS format for images. The use of color is

Tables: Avoid introducing large tables; these can be submitted as 
	Supplementary Material.

Equations: Equations must be numbered sequentially.

Acknowledgements: Acknowledgements to individuals and institutions must be 
	given just before the first Appendix or the References.

Appendices: Introduce as appendix any detailed material that may divert 
	attention to the main subject in the text.

References: Citations must appear numbered sequentially and in squared brackets,
	e.g. [2] in the text. The list of references should be placed at the end of
	the manuscript and contain complete information about the cited items.



Supplementary material


Papers in Physics encourages authors to submit supplementary material for the 
benefit of reviewers and readers. These may include images, videos, lengthy 
tables, source codes, lengthy details of experiments, calculations or protocols, 
etc. Supplementary material is subjected to the same licensing as the manuscript
